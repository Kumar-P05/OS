# Prior Knowledge

## Intoduction

This is the place where I tell you how will I learn about things that are needed to build OS.

> Here I only tell you about things that I'll learn from. To know what I'm doing right now, Refer to  [_Project OS_](https://github.com/users/Kumar-P05/projects/3).


## Process

> Resources for every thing down below are mentioned in [_Resources_](#resouces)

1. __Learn about computer architecture__: Start by learning about the different components that make up a computer, such as the CPU, memory, storage devices, and input/output devices. Understanding how these components work together will give you a better understanding of how your bootloader will interact with the system.

1. __Learn Assembly language__: Once you have a basic understanding of computer architecture, you can start 2learning Assembly language. Assembly language is a low-level programming language that allows you to directly control the computer's hardware. There are many online resources available to help you learn Assembly, such as tutorials, books, and forums.

3. __Practice programming in Assembly__: As you learn Assembly, practice writing simple programs to get comfortable with the language. You can start with small programs that print messages on the screen, perform arithmetic operations, or manipulate memory.

4. __Study existing bootloaders__: Once you have a good understanding of Assembly, study existing bootloaders to learn how they work. Try to understand how they load the operating system, how they interact with the hardware, and how they handle errors.

### From ChatGPT

1. [__Nand2Tetris__](https://www.nand2tetris.org/): This is a free online course that teaches you how to build a computer from scratch, starting with basic logic gates and working your way up to creating a high-level programming language. It covers both hardware and software aspects of computer architecture and is a great way to gain a comprehensive understanding of how computers work. This course contains 2 parts:

    1. [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
    
    2. [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II (project-centered course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)


2. [__Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python__](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/): This is a free online course offered by MIT that teaches the basics of computer science using the Python programming language. While it doesn't focus specifically on low-level programming languages, it provides a solid foundation in programming concepts and techniques that will be useful when learning Assembly.

> Link not found => 3. Assembly Language Programming: This is a paid online course offered by Udemy that teaches you how to program in Assembly language using the NASM assembler. It assumes some prior programming experience and covers topics such as data structures, control structures, and memory management.
