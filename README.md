# OS
This is my place where I'll be creating my very own OS from the scratch (Not even UNIX). As at very base level I'll be making it Open source and only private at very high level for obvious reasons - I'm making it public till I reach the private part which when I'll pack this repo. and copy it into separate private repo and complete there.
